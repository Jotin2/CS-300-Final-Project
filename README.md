# CS-300-Final-Project

1) What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem that I was solving was developing code that was able to sort and print out a list of courses in alphanumeric order from a .txt file.

2) How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

There were multiple ways to approach this problem. The different data structure options that could have been used for this project were vectors, hash tables, and lastly by using trees. Each of these data structures have its pros and cons, which I went more in depth about in my runtime analysis .docx uploaded. In short, I used a vector data structure for this project as the data size is not large, and it is easier to implement than the others.

4) How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I did not really have any roadblocks while coding the project as I had pseudocode for each data structure pre-made before I even decided which data structure to use for the Final Project. Each of my pseudocode clearly explained how to read line by line from a .txt file and transferred it to the designated data structure. So creating the pseudocode for my took the longest time as I had to make up the initial design of how my code would work.

6) How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Yes, I have never designed multiple ways to solve a problem before. In this project, I was required to create pseudocode for three different data structures before coding anything, and doing that has helped me realize the importance of desining code before actually coding.

8) How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

My work on this project has not really changed how I wrote programs that are maintainable, readable, and or adaptable. I wouold say my skill level on those area stayed the same while working on this project.
